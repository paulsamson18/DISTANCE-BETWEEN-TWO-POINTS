# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### step 1: Import numpy into the editor
### Step 2: Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them.
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Print the solution.
### Step 5: End the program. 
### PROGRAM:

       import math  as m
       l1=[4,2]
       l2=[10,6]
       d=m.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l1[1]-l2[1])**2))
       print("{:.2f}".format(d))
